Gir is a library that can be used to perform mechanical operations across multiple code bases. The workflow
typically involves cloning or updating source code from git repositories, modification and committing of
source code in the local repositories, verification of changes and finally pushing changes back to remote
repositories. Gir is a java port of the earlier version of [Zim](https://github.com/realityforge/zim).

The code base has yet to develop useful documentation. For the source code and project support please visit
the [GitHub project](https://github.com/realityforge/gir).
